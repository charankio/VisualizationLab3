Group Submission:
Using different data sets as shown below (or a new CoronaVirus Dataset that you can download to find updated graphs).

  #1 In each of the source codes, there is a comment and corresponding code about “Preparing data”. Find each one of them and explain what each one does as far as data preprocessing before drawing the figures.

  #2 Draw a bar chart to represent the total medals of Olympic 2016 of 20 first top countries. (use Olympic2016Rio.csv file)

  #3 Draw a stack bar chart to represent the Gold, Silver, Bronze medals of Olympic 2016 of 20 first top countries. (use Olympic2016Rio.csv file)

  #4 Draw a line chart to represent the actual max temperature of each month in weather statistics. (use Weather2014-15.csv file)

  #5 Draw a multi line chart to represent the actual max, min and mean temperature of each month in weather statistics. (use Weather2014-15.csv file)

  #6 Draw a bubble chart to represent the average min and max temperature of each month in weather statistics. (use Weather2014-15.csv file)

  #7 Draw a heatmap to represent the recorded max temperature on day of week and month of year. (use Weather2014-15.csv file)

Reflect on the creation of these graphs in python as far as complexity of the creation process, clarity of the figures, and usefulness as far as providing information.
